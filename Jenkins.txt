What is Jenkins?
   Jenkins is an open-source automation server written in Java that helps developers automate the building, testing, and deployment of applications.
In simple words:
   Jenkins automatically does repetitive tasks like building your code, running tests, and deploying your app to servers whenever you make changes.

Why Jenkins is Used
its mainly used for CI/CD —
that means Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery.

Process	Meaning	Jenkins Role

Continuous Integration (CI)  Developers frequently merge code into a shared repo.  Jenkins automatically builds and tests each commit to catch issues early.

Continuous Deployment (CD)  Automatically delivering code to production or test environments. Jenkins automates the deployment steps after a successful build.

How Jenkins Works

You commit code → e.g., to GitHub

Jenkins detects the change → via a webhook or schedule

It builds your project → compiles the code

Runs tests → unit tests, integration tests, etc.

Deploys your application → to a server, Docker container, or cloud platform

It does all this using pipelines (series of automated steps written in a Jenkins file).

Key Features:

Open Source & free

Integration with Git, GitHub, Bitbucket, Docker, Maven, etc.

Thousands of plugins (e.g., Slack, AWS, Azure, Kubernetes)

Build pipelines using GUI or code (Jenkinsfile)

Dashboard to monitor build status and history
